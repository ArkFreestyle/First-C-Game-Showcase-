# First-C-Game-Showcase-
Hello! I followed a C++ SFML tutorial series by subconciousbias on youtube and put together this little game. Check it out if you're interested!

When you download the code, please run the project file (.cbp) to load in all the linked classes into your IDE (I used codeblocks).
